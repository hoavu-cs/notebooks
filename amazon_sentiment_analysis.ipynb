My problem is the workers organization. Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk. One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt, another gives you just a white paper. Long wait to pick up order, took like 20 minutes. Once you get your order it is missing items from your order. Today, I was missing hashbrowns. I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead. I did not change it because two weeks ago, the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate. I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today. For this reason I'm not coming back to this place ever again. Goodbye!!!, Actual: 2, Predicted: 1\n",
